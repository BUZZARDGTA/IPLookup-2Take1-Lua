# PROJECT ARCHIVED / FAREWELL

On September 17, 2024, R* added the [BattleEye Anti-Cheat](https://www.battleye.com/) to GTA Online, meaning I can no longer work on this or any of my other scripts. All of my 2Take1 Mod Menu scripts will now be archived.

It's been a blast-fun, rewarding, and full of good vibes-to learn scripting for GTA 5, making my own stuff. But, yeah, it was never exactly allowed, and all good things must come to an end.

Thanks to everyone who supported my work, whether up close or from a distance. It really kept me motivated.

If you were into my GTA scripts, you might be interested in a project I'm still working on: [GTA-V-Session-Sniffer](https://github.com/Illegal-Services/GTA-V-Session-Sniffer).
